# Little Space World — Monorepo

A two-app monorepo for Little Space World:
- Main public site: Vite/React app (static build, deployed to Hostinger)
- Admin dashboard: Next.js 16 (App Router) dynamic app, deployed to Vercel

This README covers architecture, local dev, deployment, the bundle builder, and a debugging & audit checklist.

---

## Architecture Overview

- /src — Main Vite/React site (static)
- /app — Admin dashboard (Next.js App Router)
- /admin — static export (used only in prior builds / optional)
- /scripts — build helpers (export, etc.)
- /next.config.mjs — Next.js config (App Router)
- /package.json — monorepo root scripts
- /admin/package.json — static admin metadata (if used)
- .vercelignore, vercel.json — Vercel configuration (one or both apps)

### How apps are hosted
- Main site: Hostinger (static `dist/` build)
- Admin site: Vercel (dynamic Next.js)

Both apps share backend resources (Supabase, Stripe).

---

## Quick Start — Local development

Prereqs:
- Node 20+ and npm
- Vercel CLI (optional)
- Git

1. Clone
   git clone git@github.com:NpdWorks4Me/main.git
2. Install
   npm install
3. Run apps:
   - Main (Vite):
     cd src && npm install && npm run dev
   - Admin (Next.js):
     cd . && npm run dev:admin  # or run `next dev` at repository root targeting /app

Check `package.json` scripts for exact commands.

---

## Admin (removed)

The Admin dashboard (previously a Next.js app deployed to Vercel) has been removed from this repository and its deployment details have been archived. If you require an admin UI, create a separate repository or project and follow Hostinger or other platform docs for deployment.

> For historical reference only: Vercel-related instructions are preserved in `docs/vercel-deploy.md` (DEPRECATED).

---

## Hostinger — Main Site Deploy

- Build:
  cd src && npm run build
- Output:
  dist/ (Hostinger static hosting)
- Domain:
  littlespaceworld.com — add DNS, upload site files or use CI

If using reverse proxy/SSR at Hostinger: configure Nginx/PM2 and a build pipeline.

---

## Bundle Builder (Custom Configurator) — Overview

Located in the admin app as a reusable component (SPA/tsx):

Key features:
- Drag-and-drop (use `react-beautiful-dnd` or `react-dnd`) mobile friendly
- `availableProducts`: fetched array of product objects: {id, name, price, inventory, imageUrl, group}
- State:
  - `bundleState` via Context/Reducer (BundleProvider)
  - `selectedItems`: [{ id, name, price, quantity, group, imageUrl }]
  - `totalCost`, `remainingSlots`, `validationErrors`
- Validation Rules:
  - Min items: 3
  - Max items: 8
  - Required group: at least one from `Required_Base`
  - Pricing: totalCost = sum(price * quantity)
- Behavior:
  - Drag from Source (inventory) to Target (Gift Box)
  - Dropping same item increments quantity
  - Removal via X button or click-and-hold
  - Visual rejection when violating a rule (snap back)
  - Checkout disabled if validationErrors not empty

Exports:
- `finalizeBundle()` returns JSON string: e.g., [{"id":"A1","q":2},{"id":"B3","q":1}]
- Integrate finalizeBundle to add slot product + bundle metadata to cart (Shopify/WooCommerce API)

---

## Integration Notes

1. Create a slot product: `CUSTOM-BUNDLE-SLOT`
2. At checkout:
   - Add slot product to cart
   - Attach serialized JSON as line item metadata
3. Post-checkout:
   - Backend webhook reads metadata, reduces inventory quantities accordingly
   - Fulfillment team uses metadata to pack items

---

## Testing and QA

- Manual:
  - Test drag & drop on mobile (touch), test quantity increment, removal
  - Validate UI error flows (dropping too many items)
- Automated:
  - Unit tests: Jest (bundle reducer + validation)
  - E2E: Playwright tests for drag-and-drop flows & checkout serialization
- Build verification:
  - On local machine: npx vercel build  (check framework detection)
  - On Vercel: redeploy and watch logs (install time should be realistic > 5s for real projects)

---

## Migration & Audit Checklist

When migrating or debugging:
1. package.json — confirm `next`, `react`, `react-dom` in dependencies
2. Root Directory — correct in Vercel Settings
3. next.config.mjs — ensure `output: 'export'` is not forced for Vercel dynamic builds (use env VERCEL=1 to toggle)
4. Avoid window/document usage during SSR (wrap or dynamic import with ssr:false)
5. Ensure images.domains configured in next.config.mjs
6. Separate public & server env vars (prefix with NEXT_PUBLIC_ where appropriate)
7. Avoid shipping .next or dist in repo unless GitHub Pages/Hostinger expects static files
8. Validate .vercelignore doesn't exclude package.json or app directories
9. Add vercel-build script where necessary:
   - "vercel-build": "next build" (or custom build steps)
10. If monorepo, configure per-project root settings or use a single monorepo-aware setup

---

## Security & Environment

- Secrets:
  - Keep server-only keys out of client bundles (no NEXT_PUBLIC prefix)
  - Vercel environment variables: set as "Environment Variable" with Production scope and masking
- Use service roles for server tasks (e.g., inventory deduction)

## Quick Troubleshooting

- 404 on root domain: confirm root `app/page.tsx` or redirect and verify admin routes
- 404 on admin: check Next.js app router routes, ensure pages exist (app/+server/ or app/page.tsx)
- Next.js not detected on Vercel: check root directory and package.json `next` entry
- Static vs dynamic: ensure next.config.mjs `output` toggles appropriately based on `process.env.VERCEL`
