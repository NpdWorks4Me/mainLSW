name: DEPRECATED - hostinger-deploy (moved)

# This workflow is deprecated and kept only for audit/history. Use
# .github/workflows/hostinger-deploy-main.yml which only builds and deploys
# the main Vite site (dist). The old workflow previously contained admin
# build and deploy steps; those were removed to ensure CI only handles the
# main site.
